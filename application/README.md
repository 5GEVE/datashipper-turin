# Application metrics collectors

## Install

### Collectors

Install the collectors with the provided playbook.

> Note: You need to configure key-based SSH access to the remote host for this to work.

```shell script
ansible-playbook -i "<host-ip-address>," -u <user> -K install_application.yml
```

> *Note:*
>
> - do not forget to include the comma after `<host-ip-address>`
> - default user is `ubuntu`, override it with `-u`
> - request for `sudo` password is prompted by `-K`

### Use the TestCase Blueprint template

[tcb_template.yaml](tcb_template.yaml) provides a TCB example to be onboarded on the 5G EVE portal.
It shows the integration of the data shipper with topics generated by 5G EVE and parameters.

> Note: check IP addresses

To onboard the blueprint on the portal you need to convert it to JSON.
To convert from YAML to JSON you can use `yq` ([yq on GitHub](https://github.com/kislyuk/yq),
[docs](https://kislyuk.github.io/yq/)).

```shell script
yq . tcb_template.yaml > tcb_template.json
```
